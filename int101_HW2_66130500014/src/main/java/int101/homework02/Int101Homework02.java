       1.3 Create a public method named "testPositive" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method receives a parameter of type "double" named "value"
           and it returns the "value" if this "value" is a positive value.
           Otherwise, it throws IllegalArgumentException.
       1.4 Create a public method named "computeIsbn10" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method recieves a parameter of type "long" named "isbn10"
           and it returns the value of "isbn10" whose last digit is modified
           to make it a valid ISBN-10.

           initialized to 1_000_000_000.
       3.3 a private final "no" field of type "long".

       3.5 a private "balance" field of type "double".
       3.6 a public constructor that receives an "owner" parameter of
           type "Person" to set the "owner" field. This method throws
           NullPointerException if the "owner" parameter is null.
           This method sets the value of "no" field to be the result from
           sending the "nextId" field to "Utilitor.computeIsbn10" method;
           and then increments the value of "nextId" by 10.

           named "amount". This method throws IllegalArgumentException
           if "amount" does not pass "Utilitor.testPositive" method.
           Otherwise, the method subtracts the "amount" from "balance"
           and then returns the new "balance".  However, this method will not
           do so if the new "balance" cannot pass "Utilitor.testPositive" method.
       3.10 a public method named "transfer" that recieves a "double" parameter
            named "amount" and an "Account" parameter named "account".

            or it cannot "withdraw" the "amount" from this object. Otherwise,
            this method "withdraw" the "amount" from this object and "deposit"
